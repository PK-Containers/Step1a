This is a very simple step to understand basics involved in converting a stateless microservice app into a container service.

The scope of this step is to just understand how to build a docker image, run and view logs.

		1. git clone https://github.com/PK-Containers/Step1a.git
		
		2. cd Step1a
		
		3. To build the docker image
		    docker build -t helloworld .
		    
		4. To run the container
		    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 helloworld
		    
		    -d => run in detached mode(background)
		
		5. To check if the container is running
		    docker ps
    
		    ============================================================================================
		    
		    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS        NAMES
		4d885e64f451        helloworld          "python hello.py"   28 seconds ago      Up 27 seconds       0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp       competent_minsky    
		    ============================================================================================
		    
		
		6. To validate results in browser ->
		    http://localhost:8080/
		        displays, Hello World from host "<your container id>".
		        
		7. To view logs
		    docker logs <container_id> or <container_name>
		    docker logs competent_minsky [or]
		    docker logs 4d885e64f451
		    
		8. To get into container shell
		    docker exec -it <container_id> sh
		    
		    Instead of sh, sometimes use bash or /bin/bash, based on your Dockerfile
		    
		9. To view all docker process status(including non running containers)
		    docker ps -a
